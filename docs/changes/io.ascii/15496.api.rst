Removed usage of ``OrderedDict`` from several files within the ``io.ascii`` subpackage. Affected files include: ``core.py``, ``daophot.py``, ``ecsv.py``, ``fastbasic.py``, ``ipac.py``, and ``test_read.py``. With the guaranteed insertion order in dictionaries from Python 3.7 onwards, the shift to standard dictionaries simplifies the code and reduces reliance on specialized data structures. This refactoring aligns with issue #10888.
